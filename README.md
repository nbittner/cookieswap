    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Food52 Holiday Swap is an annual \"Secret Santa\" style event where members of the Food52.com community can opt to send packages to other participants around the world of homemade sweets and local sweets. Since its inception in 2010, it has steadily grown to include over 1,200 participants yearly. Here, we developed a model to identify Food52 users who are likely to be good Holiday Swap participants based on their user profiles but have not yet joined. The use case for this model is specific and to be used once yearly during ramp-up to the Holiday Swap when we are advertising in October/November. \n",
